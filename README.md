![App Logo](/dietapplogo.jpg)

EatWell is the final project for my course in mobile applications development.

## Inspiration:
- EatWell is inspired by my desire to live a more health conscious life.

## Purpose: 
The app 
- Tracks what the user eats each day over a given month.
- Tracks the number of calories the user burns in a day
- Lets the user provide notes about each meal entry.

## Scenes:
Snapshot
- In this scence, the user can see their calories consumed, their calories burned, their steps walked, and their current stand time (for today).

Profile

## Frameworks:
- UIKit: I utilitized UIKit to build the interface.

- CoreData: I utilized CoreData to store and persist user data after closure of the app. 

- HealthKit: I utilized HealthKit to read information from the user's health app (e.g. calories burned, steps walked, stand time, weight, sex, height)
