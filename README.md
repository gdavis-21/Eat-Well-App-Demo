# EatWell: An App to Track and Document What You Eat

## Purpose: 
- My partners and I designed Eat Well to provide users with an easy and efficient way to track what the user eats over a given month.
- The app is broken down into three scenes:
  1. Snapshot - Provides a broad overview of your day (e.g. calories consumed, calories burned, steps walked, and stand time)
  2. Journal - Provides a way to track and document calories consumed as well as provide additional notes about day.
  3. Profile - Provides general information about the user (name, age, weight, sex, and height)

## Frameworks:
- UIKit: 
- CoreData: to store entries of the tableView in the Journal Scene.
- HealthKit: to read information from the user's health app (e.g. calories burned, steps walked, stand time, weight, sex, height)
